# Security Policy

## Introduction

No program is bug-free. It is an accepted reality in software development that achieving a completely error-free application is nearly impossible, particularly when the development is done during spare moments carved out of personal time. Despite these constraints, I am committed to implementing robust security measures in my projects. My projects, primarily tools designed for personal little-use, are crafted with diligence and an ongoing consideration for security, even though they may not always meet the stringent standards expected in commercial software.

The nature of open-source software, developed transparently and collaboratively, allows for community involvement which can be a double-edged sword: it offers the potential for diverse contributions and improvements, but also exposes the code to various security risks. Recognizing this, I strive to maintain a proactive stance on security, aiming to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities as part of the development and maintenance process. Your cooperation and input are invaluable in this endeavor, ensuring that the software remains as secure as possible despite the informal nature of its development.
GitHub is a place where people come together, share code and collaborate across the whole world. I see every report as a chance to learn from others who have experience in special areas.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in any of my projects, I encourage you to notify me as quickly as possible. I ask that you please do the following:

1. **Contact me directly:** You can find my contact information in the GitHub profile or in the project README. Alternatively, you can contact me on LinkedIn. Please do not disclose the issue publicly before it has been resolved.

2. **Provide detailed information:** Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any suggestions you might have for how to fix it.

3. **Allow me reasonable time to respond:** Since these projects are maintained in my spare time, it might take me some time to respond. I appreciate your patience and understanding.

## Security Practices

Here are some of the measures I take to ensure the security of my projects:


- **Dependency management:** I strive to keep all project dependencies up-to-date and review them for known vulnerabilities.

- **Encryption and hashing:** When needed, I use different encryption and hashing libraries and algorithms to ensure critical data is secure
  

## Disclosure Policy

When a reported vulnerability is confirmed, I will take the following steps:

1. **Acknowledge receipt of your report:** I will provide an initial response to your report within a short period of time, acknowledging its receipt.

2. **Work on a fix:** I will work on a timely fix based on the severity of the vulnerability, if possible.

3. **Release an update:** Once a fix is ready, an update will be released through the usual update channels.

4. **Announce the update:** I will inform users of the system update and encourage them to upgrade as soon as possible.

5. **Credit:** Contributors who report vulnerabilities will be credited for their efforts if they choose to be acknowledged.

## Conclusion

Security is taken seriously, and all reports are considered a top priority. However, since this is a project developed in personal capacity, responses and resolutions are managed as promptly as personal time allows.

Thank you for helping keep this project safe and secure.
